SWEEP, a sound wave editor, brought to you by Conrad Parker
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sweep is an audio editor and live playback tool for GNU/Linux, BSD and
compatible systems. It supports many music and voice formats including
WAV, AIFF, Ogg Vorbis, Speex and MP3, with multichannel editing and
LADSPA effects plugins. Inside lives a pesky little virtual stylus called
Scrubby who enjoys mixing around in your files.

Sweep is designed to be intuitive and to give you full control. It includes
almost everything you would expect in a sound editor, and then some:

        * precise, vinyl like scrubbing
        * looped, reverse, and pitch-controlled playback
        * playback mixing of unlimited independent tracks
	* monitoring support for use with multiple audio devices
        * looped and reverse recording
        * internationalisation
        * multichannel and 32 bit floating point file support
	* Ogg Vorbis, MP3 and Speex compressed formats
	* sample rate conversion and channel operations
        * LADSPA 1.1 effects support
        * multiple views, discontinuous selections
        * easy keybindings, mouse wheel zooming
        * unlimited undo/redo with fully revertible edit history
        * multithreaded background processing
        * shaded peak/mean waveform rendering, multiple colour schemes


Summary of library dependencies:
--------------------------------

REQUIRED:

        * GTK+ 1.2, standard in most distributions and available from:

	    http://www.gtk.org/

        * libsndfile-1.0.x, available from:

            http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/

	* Secret Rabbit Code, aka. libsamplerate, available from:

	    http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/
	
OPTIONAL:

See the file INSTALL for building instructions. Generally all that is
required, after the above libraries have been installed, is:

	make install

If you are not sure what you need, simply run ./configure and it will probe
your system and provide a reasonably useful summary.

./configure --help
