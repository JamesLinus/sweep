Support for ALSA 0.9 is functional and could do with widespread testing.

To build with alsa support, simply configure with:

	./configure --enable-alsa

Note that this will build a binary which will work with ALSA only, and
not attempt to use OSS. In future this will be replaced with plugins
for different pcm i/o methods, which should ease binary distribution.

ALSA native support it currently not working; to even attempt to build the
code, you must configure with:

	./configure --enable-experimental --enable-alsa

However, Sweep works fine with ALSA under OSS emulation.

Support for ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) version 0.6.0 was
added by Paul Barton-Davis <pbd@op.net>.

To build sweep with support for ALSA 0.6.0, do:

        ./configure --enable-alsa
        make

Paul writes:

  To use ALSA, you need --enable-alsa as an arg to configure,
  because just discovering ALSA is not deemed to be sufficient to use
  it (at this time).

  A couple of things to note:

         * this is ALSA 0.6.0, which is only available via CVS right now
         * this code is totally different than the code needed for 0.5.X
         * you also need a ~/.asoundrc file to define the
               characteristics of various "named PCM devices"
         * you can define the environment variable SWEEP_ALSA_PCM to
               the name of the PCM device you want sweep to use
         * if its not defined, sweep will try to open a named PCM
               device called "sweep"
